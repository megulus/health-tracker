### Acknowledgements

Thanks to [this Stack Overflow Article](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10858935/cleanest-way-to-destroy-every-model-in-a-collection-in-backbone) for helping to clear up an issue I ran into in attempting to clear a collection/destroy its models.

I used the [Backbone.Modal.js](http://awkward.github.io/backbone.modal/) plugin to create my modal dialogue box.

This [article on filtering Collections](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11762105/filter-backbone-collection-by-attribute-value) was helpful in figuring out how to chain various filtering methods, which was useful for the purposes of sorting by day, week, month and year.
